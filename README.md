This is the example app for the first Angular Meetup in Heidelberg.
We will bring it to life together.

### Install and run

You need the Angular CLI to be installed globally:

```bash
npm install @angular/cli
```

Clone the repo and run the local installation:

```bash
npm install
```

You might want to build the `cart` library first which is part of this repo:

```bash
ng run cart:build
```

After that you're ready to start the app:

```bash
ng serve
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:4200` to see it in action.
